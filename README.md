## 🤖 Overview

**Robotick** is a high-performance, modular C++ runtime for robotics and control systems - engineered for reliability, introspection, and composability across the full spectrum of platforms.

From bare-metal microcontrollers like the STM32 and ESP32 to Raspberry Pi, desktop systems, and edge-AI devices like NVIDIA Jetson (arm64), Robotick delivers real-time precision where it counts, and excellent performance everywhere else - without sacrificing ease of use or flexibility.

## 🚀 What is Robotick?

Robotick is a modern control engine designed to execute structured workloads with:

- Predictable, real-time performance
- Introspectable config, input, and output fields
- Zero-allocation memory buffer layout
- Modular composition and orchestration
- Full lifecycle management (load, start, tick, stop)
- Remote telemetry and future remote control

Built for early learners and industry professionals alike, Robotick is simple enough for educational bots and sophisticated enough for serious research and development.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 Modular Workloads

Each unit of logic is a workload - a small, testable module with clearly defined inputs, outputs, and config:

```cpp
struct HelloWorkload {
    HelloConfig config;
    HelloInputs inputs;
    HelloOutputs outputs;

    void tick(const TickInfo& tick_info);
};
```

Reflection macros make every field visible and usable for config, scripting, or telemetry.

### 🔁 Real-Time Engine

- Individual tick rates per workload
- Deterministic scheduling
- Ready for multithreaded execution
- Exceptionally consistent timing on MCUs
- Excellent latency characteristics on general-purpose platforms

### Composition System

Compose workloads into rich behaviours:

- `SequenceWorkload`: run workloads in order
- `SyncedPairWorkload`: parallel aligned ticking
- Future: event-driven, reactive, and conditional branching

### 🔬 Introspection & Reflection

Every field in config, inputs, and outputs is exposed at runtime, enabling:

- Remote configuration
- Schema-aware scripting
- Full field inspection for telemetry

No boilerplate. No fuss. Just structured access to everything that matters.

### 📡 Remote Telemetry & UI

Designed for live telemetry from the start:

- Structured data streaming
- Pluggable transport backends (UART, MQTT, etc.)
- UI- and scripting-ready introspection
- Foundation for remote tuning and remote control

### 🐍 Python Bindings

Use Python to:

- Orchestrate workload execution
- Inspect and modify live system state
- Visualise real-time data
- Integrate with scientific workflows

Zero-copy overlay support is in progress for high-efficiency interop.

#### Configuring the embedded Python runtime

`PythonWorkload` calls `ensure_python_runtime()` the first time it touches the interpreter. By default we import the standard `site` module and trust whatever user-level package directories exist on the host. If you need deterministic startup (skip `site`) or want to add workspace-specific module paths, configure the runtime up front:

```cpp
#include "robotick/systems/PythonRuntime.h"

using namespace robotick;

namespace
{
const char* const kPythonPaths[] = {"/home/robotick/workspaces/robotick-core-workloads/python"};
}

int main()
{
    PythonRuntimeConfig config;
    config.import_site = false;      // skip site packages for MCU determinism
    config.allow_user_site = false;  // ignore ~/.local/lib/python...
    config.extra_module_paths = kPythonPaths;
    config.extra_module_path_count = 1;
    set_python_runtime_config(config);

    // build/load Engine + workloads as usual
}
```

Pointers supplied via `extra_module_paths` must outlive the process (static arrays work well). You can also provide `post_init_hook` to run custom CPython setup while the GIL is held.

### 🧪 Simulation-First Testing

Built to be tested:

- Mockable physics interfaces
- Unit testable workloads
- Consistent simulated timing for verification
- Easy integration with CI

### ⚠️ Error Reporting + Metrics

Workloads should always pair log messages with a metric/output so operators (Hub/CLI) can see the same fault the log reports. The recommended pattern (also shown in `TemplateWorkload.cpp`) is:

```cpp
if (!sensor_ok)
{
    ROBOTICK_WARNING("sensor '%s' below threshold (%d < %d)", inputs.sensor_label.c_str(), inputs.sensor_value, config.threshold);
    outputs.status = "sensor below threshold";
    outputs.warning_count++; // telemetry counter surfaced to Hub
}
```

Use `ROBOTICK_INFO/WARNING/ERROR` depending on severity, and update an output/telemetry counter each time to keep systems observable.
